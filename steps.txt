1## linus torvald(father of linux and git(distributed version control system))
git main features
a. saves snapshots(commits) not differences
b. almost every opertion is local
c. git has integrity(creates .git folder(it keeps all the history/version of project and its files) if anyone changes file in it, it tells us(by internally keeping track of sha checksums))
d. git generally only adds data

#github, bitbucket, gitlab etc are hosting services for remote git repositories


2## install git then we get command line tools to run various command in our terminal


#run command if it's a git repo- 
>git status

#now first of all configure username and email in git(becoz it will tell u who has committed/snapshot the changes)
>git config --global user.name "name"
>git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"

then run(to get all the details)- 
>git config --list

to get specific details then run- 
>git config user.name or user.email

to select an editor in linux run- 
>git config --global core.editor emacs or vim(chosed this) or nano


3## three stage architecture in git
1 working directory- where we gonna create and work on project files
2 staging area- all the files that we gonna commit in the next commit(means saves the snapshot of all the files)
3 git directory(repository)- this is where we will hv all the files that will be saved after the commit.


4## created a file first.txt, first.js and first.py
then run-
>git status

to create a git repo/directory
>git init
then run-
>git status

to add all the files in the staging area run-
>git add --a

then to commit the files to git repository
>git commit -m "message"
the run- 
>git status

to know how many commits are there(and if we want to move to that commit changes, all the details are there), run-
>git log

made changes in first.txt and steps.txt
now to add specific file to the staging area, run-
>git add first.txt

then to commit changes- 
git commit -m "some message"

***never run git init if a git repository is already there. so always check with- git status


5## to clone a remote git repository- 
>git clone url  or git clone url name_we_want

to remove the .git folder run(use this very carefully!)-
>rm -rf .git

now go the repository folder that u hv jst cloned and run- git status
this folder already hv .git folder, so it will keep track of every change we gonna make..

made change in readme file then run- 
>git add --a
>git status
>git commit -m "some message"
>git status
>git log


##6 file status life cycle- untracked  ->  unmodified(when we use add --a first time)  ->  modified  ->  staged  ->  unmodified(after commit)  

again making this FC_git_by_harry folder a git repository
>git status
>git init
>git add --a  or git add .   (both are same)

then make change in first.txt (it will go in modified area) and run- 
>git add first.txt   (now it will be in staged area)


##7 git ignore- create a file named .gitignore run- touch .gitignore

>touch error.log 
>touch .gitignore 
>git status

edit .gitignore file and add error.log(filename) there then run- 
>git status

if we want to ignore all the file related to an extension add *.log(of .log eextension files) in .gitignore file

if we dont want to track a whole directory with files(means not a blank directory) then add dir_name/

again created a new directory static with some sub-directory(also hv file.js) and file.js
now when we run git status it will show static as untracked directory. so run- 
>git add .
>git status 

and if we only want to ignore outer directory then /directory_name/
and if we only want to ignore inner directory then static/directory_name

and we can also add complex patterns in .gitignore file.


##8 difference b/w  working directory and staging area and difference b/w last commit and staging area

it will compare the working directory(i.e. modified) with the staging area, run- 
>git diff
first block is staging area and 2nd block is working directory

now to compare staging area with the last commit, run- 
>git diff --staged
first block is last commit and 2nd block is staging area


##9 skipping the staging area, run- 
>git commit -a -m "direct commit"

and if we create a new file and we use above command that will not be committed!


##10 moving and renaming files in git

rename a file manually and then run- 
>git status    (git will say u hv deleted the previous file and added a new file)

>git add .   (now in staging area it will now that we hv jst changed its name)

>git commit -m "renamed a file"

how to remove a file using git, run- 
>git rm file_name    it will delete the file as well as move the change to staging area(it is not the case when deleting a file manually)
>git commit -m "removed a file"

how to rename(moving is also same in ubuntu) a file using git, run-
>git mv file_name renamed_file_name   it will rename the file as well as move the change to staging area(it is not the case when deleting a file manually)
>git commit -m "renamed a file"

what if we add a file_name in .gitignore that we are tracking from the starting
added file_name in .gitignore 
>git status 
>git commit -a -m "changed gitignore file"

if we modify this file that we hv jst added in .gitignore file
>git status    (git will still track that file what we hv jst added in .gitignore file)

now to explicitly tracking of this file and add it in staging area, run-
>git rm --cached file_name    
>git status   (git will show that it is deleted from the git folder. but it is not deleted from working directory)
>git commit -m "removed file_name"
>git status

again make changes in first.txt to make sure that git is not tracking it!!


##11 viewing and changing commits in git-
>rm -rf .git
then clone a repo, run-
>git clone url name_we_want

cd to that package/library and then run-
>git status
>git log
>git log -3

to see the changes in file with logs
>git log -p

to see the 3 latest changes in file with logs
>git log -p -3

to get the short summary of the changes with logs
>git log --stat

to get the limited details of commits in one line
>git log --pretty=oneline

to get the very limited details of commits in one line(if dont want to see diff, sha, date)
>git log --pretty=short (author and commit msg)
>git log --pretty=full   (committed by)

to get log as per no. of days 
>git log --since=2.days
>git log --since=2.weeks
>git log --since=2.months
>git log --since=2.years

to get the more specific details with git log
>git log --pretty=format:"%h -- %an"
>git log --pretty=format:"%h -- %ae"  
for other aphabets- https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log   search for- Placeholders that expand to information extracted from the commit

to amend the last commit with your changes-
>make changes in a file then
>git add .
>git commit --amend   (then make changes using vim editor i, esc , :q, :qa, :wq and no need to commit the changes after this)
>git log -p -1


##12 unstaging and unmodifing-
removed myPandaName package

if i make change in a file and move it to stage area using command-
>git add name_of_file

now to unstage this file, run-
>git restore --staged file_name
>git status

now if i mistakenly deleted the file content and save it and close that file
now to get the last commit content of that file
>git checkout -- file_name  
>git status
(**use this commands carefully becoz u will lost ur current changes
and **if you hv staged the file changes than this will not get the last commit content)

**same thing for all the files that u hv changed their content
**use this commands carefully
>git checkout -f

to restore a working directory from changes(means to undo the changes)
**use this commands carefully
>git restore file_name

how to visit 2nd last or any commit changes???(>git checkout HEAD~2,3 moves backwards by two,three commits.)
>git branch 
>git checkout branch_name t0 switch the branch


##13 working with remote repositories
created a git repo on github named- FC_git_tutorial

remote means a repo here
>git remote

here origin means name of the url
>git remote add origin https://github.com/SRHOODA/FC_git_tutorial.git
>git remote

to check the pull(fetch) and push urls
>git remote -v

to push changes on remote repository-
>git branch -M main
>git push -u origin main

we can also push code using SSH and GPG keys(search for generate SSH keys for github)
